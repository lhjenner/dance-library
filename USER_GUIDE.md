### Segment-Level Tags

Apply to specific segments:
- More specific than video tags
- Example: `"reverse whip"`, `"open position"`
- Video inherits both video and segment tags

### Tag Best Practices

**Use consistent names:**
- ✅ `"whip"` everywhere
- ❌ `"whip"`, `"whips"`, `"Whip"` mixed

**Be specific with segments:**
- Video: `"whip"`, `"lindy hop"`
- Segment 1: `"reverse whip"`
- Segment 2: `"open whip"`

**Use multiple tags:**
- Style: `"lindy hop"`, `"west coast swing"`
- Level: `"beginner"`, `"intermediate"`, `"advanced"`
- Move type: `"whip"`, `"swing out"`, `"sugar push"`
